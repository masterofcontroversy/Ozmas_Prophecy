Do we need any more?[A]

//Devan
[MidLeft]
No, that should do for now.[A]

//Ronni

Then I'm taking a break.[ANL]
I think we'll need to break[NL]
out the coffee for this one.[A]
[MoveLeft][MoveFarFarLeft][ClearFace]

//Devan
[MidLeft]
You can just sleep if you want.[.5][NL]
I can handle myself for a few hours.[A]

//Ronni
[FarFarLeft]
You're one to talk.[ANL]
If anyone needs[NL]
sleep, it's you.[A]

Good morning.[ANL]
[Beat]My, you look dreadful.[NL]
Are you alright?[A]

//Devan
[Left]
Peachy.[.5] What do you want?[A]

//Alexandra
[MidRight]
I came to discuss our[NL]
next course of action.[A]

//Devan
[Left]
Pardon?[A]

//Alexandra
[MidRight]
We're going to rescue[NL]
Count Varley, yes?[A]

//Devan
[Left]
[OpenQuote]We?[CloseQuote][A]

//Alexandra
[MidRight]
Yes, [OpenQuote]we.[CloseQuote][.5] Is there a problem?[A]

//Devan
[Left]
You've done as you promised --[.4][NL]
to your detriment, I'll add.[ANL]
Why risk both your well-being[NL]
and your standing with Caius?[A]

//Alexandra
[MidRight]
Is it truly so difficult to believe I simply[NL]
wish to ensure the rescue's success?[A]

//Devan
[Left]
Not without something to gain.[ANL]
How do I know that[NL]
something won't cost me?[A]

[FarLeft][LoadRonni]
The water's on.[NL]
[Beat]Did I miss something?[A]

//Devan
[Left]
Nothing important.[ANL]
[Beat]If you really want to help,[NL]
Miss Quirin, guard Glasswater.[A]

//Alexandra
[MidRight]
I just offered you more than[NL]
double your number of men,[ANL]
and your first instinct[NL]
is to disregard them?[A]

//Devan
[Left]
I need someone to keep the[NL]
town safe and distract the Masons.[A]

//Ronni
[FarLeft]
Besides, we can't have too many[NL]
people on a stealth misson.[A]

//Alexandra
[MidRight]
Stealth mission?[.4] So that's[NL]
what these maps are for.[A]

//Devan
[Left]
Ronni[Beat][A]

//Ronni
[FarLeft]
It doesn't hurt[NL]
to say, right?[A]

//Devan
[Left]
[Beat]Go ahead.[A]

//Ronni
[FarLeft]
There's a tunnel system[NL]
under Masaint Keep.[ANL]
We'll use that to sneak[NL]
in and get Max out.[A]

//Alexandra
[MidRight]
Very clever.[.5] Though I can't[NL]
imagine the escape being easy.[A]

//Devan
[Left]
That's exactly why you're staying.[ANL]
You Tolvans aren't used to these[NL]
conditions.[.5] You'd slow us down.[A]

//Alexandra
[MidRight]
Slow you down for what?[ANL]
Your escape through snow the[NL]
rebels will use to track you?[ANL]
What if you're found out[N]
before you escape the keep?[A]

//Devan
[Left]
Then we'll provide the count the[NL]
time and cover he needs to escape.[A]

//Alexandra
[MidRight]
If you're likely to fight anyway,[NL]
you might as well start with an ambush.[A]

//Devan
[Left]
This task is already suicidal enough.[.4][NL]
Why would we make it more perilous?[A]

//Alexandra
[MidRight]
You're considering it without[NL]
taking my men into account.[ANL]
We already have the element of surprise.[NL]
With my help, you'll have better odds.[ANL]
It would also mean Masaint would[NL]
start on the road to recovery sooner.[A]

//Devan
[Left]
Or we could come face to face with[NL]
a roused army and get ourselves killed.[A]

//Alexandra
[MidRight]
What makes praying for inattentive[NL]
guards and a swift getaway any better?[A]

//Ronni
[FarLeft]
Well, none of it really[NL]
matters if we can't get Max out.[a]

//Devan
[Left]
[Beat]Right.[.4] Any suggestions?[A]

//Ronni
[FarLeft]
Hmm[Beat] Breaking the door would[NL]
take too long and be too noisy[Beat][ANL]
We could pick the lock.[A]

//Alexandra
[MidRight]
You have a locksmith in your ranks?[A]

//Ronni
[FarLeft]
No, but there are[NL]
some thieves in town.[A]

//Devan
[Left]
You mean the ones that caught[NL]
the attention of the Masons?[A]

//Ronni
[FarLeft]
Got any better ideas?[A]

//Devan
[Left]
[Beat]Alright. I'll look into it.[.5][NL]
Do either of you know where Lucy went?[A]

//Alexandra
[MidRight]
The south side of town, I believe.[A]

//Devan
[Left]
Then I'll start there.[.4] You coming?[A]

Hey![A]

Then I'd like to hire your services.[ANL]

I'm willing to pay[NL]

You're a Duramontan.[.5] A noble,[NL]

Your best offer is about as[NL]

That must count for something.[A]

Did you see any other recourse?[ANL]
If we're to ensure this mission's[NL]

you given my suggestion any thought?[A]

//Devan

//Alexandra
[MidLeft]
If you want to help Glasswater,[NL]
it's the best course of action.[A]

//Devan
[MidRight]
Swiftest, maybe, but far too[NL]
dangerous to be the best.[A]

//Alexandra
[MidLeft]
Would it not also be dangerous to tarry[NL]
while the people of Masaint suffer?[A]

//Devan
[MidRight]
[Beat]I'll consider it if, and only if,[NL]
the conditions are right.[ANL]
Even with my troops and your elites,[NL]
we could still be at a disadvantage.[A]

//Alexandra
[MidLeft]
That's why I suggested we all--[A]

//Devan
[MidRight]
Again, someone needs to guard the town.[NL]
The idea is to help the people, remember?[ANL]
And that aside, if the Masons notice our[NL]
absence, they might warn of our arrival.[A]

//Alexandra
[MidLeft]
Oh, alright.[.5] Anything else?[A]

//Devan
