[FarFarRight]
You're up early.[A]
[CloseSpeechSlow]
[Right][LoadRonni]
[.4]

//Devan
[MidLeft]
I didn't get any sleep,[NL]
so I thought I'd make myself useful.[A]

//Ronni
[Right]
Did you come up[NL]
with anything?[A]

//Devan
[MidLeft]
Nothing ideal.[ANL]
Our safest option would be[NL]
to turn back and get help.[A]

//Ronni
[Right]
How long would that take?[A]

//Devan
[MidLeft]
At least a few days,[NL]
assuming we get any.[A]

//Ronni
[Right]
That'd take too long.[A]

//Devan
[MidLeft]
Alternatively, we could take a[NL]
chance on the crags north of here.[ANL]
It's unlikely anyone[NL]
would be patrolling there.[ANL]
However, we'd have to abandon[NL]
our mounts and half our supplies.[A]

//Ronni
[Right]
That'd make the whole[NL]
rescue part a lot harder.[ANL]
Anything else?[A]

//Devan
[MidLeft]
Unfortunately, no.[A]

//Ronni
[Right]
So it's either sit around or not[NL]
be able to rescue Max and Janice?[A]

//Devan
[MidLeft]
I'm sorry.[A]

//Alexandra
[FarFarRight]
Perhaps I could[NL]
be of some help?[A]
[CloseSpeechSlow]

[FarRight][LoadAlexandra]
[.4]

//Devan
[MidLeft]
How long were you[NL]
eavesdropping?[A]

//Alexandra
[FarRight]
Long enough to learn of your quagmire.[ANL]
Should you add my forces to your own,[NL]
we could ward off the Stonemasons.[A]

//Devan
[MidLeft]
You were told to remain here[NL]
until further notice, correct?[ANL]
Why are you so eager[NL]
to disregard Caius' orders?[A]

//Alexandra
[FarRight]
I have my reasons.[A]

//Devan
[MidLeft]
Is that supposed to convince me?[A]

//Alexandra
[FarRight]
With your circumstances,[NL]
I didn't think it necessary.[ANL]
Any alternatives would[NL]
waste precious time.[ANL][ToggleSmile]
Were you not concerned[NL]
about that yesterday?[A]

[ToggleSmileFar]

//Devan
[MidLeft]
[BeatSmooth][A]

//Ronni
[Right]
It's our best shot at[NL]
finding Max and Janice.[A]

//Devan
[MidLeft]
[Beat]Fine.[.4] I accept your offer.[ANL]
But only on the grounds that[NL]
you will answer to me.[.5] Understood?[A]

//Alexandra
[FarRight]
Understood.[ANL]
I'll prepare my troops.[NL]
By your leave.[A]
[ClearFace]

//Devan
[MidLeft]
[Beat]Keep a close eye on her.[A]

//Ronni
[Right]
What for?[A]

//Devan
[MidLeft]
I might not know the reason,[NL]
but I can tell she's ambitious.[ANL]
And if I know anything about[NL]
ambitious Tolvans, she's trouble.[A]

Who was that man and[NL]
why was he chasing you?[A]

//Lucy
[Left]
Oh,[.4] uh[Beat] That[NL]
was a Stonemason.[ANL]
I[Beat]bumped into[NL]
him on the road.[A]

//Devan

Is that all?[A]

You must have done[NL]
something to anger him so.[A]

Back from scouting already?[NL]
What did you find?[A]

//Evelyn
[FarRight]
Several men marching on[NL]
a small town east of here.[ANL]
They seem to have[NL]
come from the mountains.[A]

//Devan
[Right]
Sounds to me like the Stonemasons[NL]
are attacking Glasswater.[A]

//Lucy
[FarLeft]
What!?[A]

//Alexandra
[Left]
This could be our chance to slip[NL]
by while the bandits are occupied.[A]

//Lucy
[FarLeft]
You're just going to leave them?[NL]
Aren't you knights?[A]

//Alexandra
[Left]
Our mission is of more[NL]
importance than a mere hamlet.[A]

//Devan
[Right]
We're helping.[A]

//Alexandra
[Left]
If we fight, the attention drawn to[NL]
us will make our search more difficult.[ANL]
If we go to another town, we can[NL]
more easily inquire about the Varleys.[A]

//Devan
[Right]
Perhaps, but my mind is unchanged.[NL]
It's my charge.[A]

//Alexandra
[Left]
[Beat]So be it.[A]

Here we are.[A]

//Devan
[MidLeft]
Go hide in the woods.[NL]
We'll take it from here.[A]

//Lucy
[MidRight]

attacked again? No thank you.[A]

You thought to steal[NL]
from the Masons?[A]

Eheheh[Beat][A]

//Devan
[MidLeft]
[Beat]We'll discuss it later.[NL]
Can you fight?[A]

[MidLeft][LoadVillageWoman3]
Thanks for checking up on me.[ANL]
Hey,[.4] before you go,[NL]
take this elixir with you.[ANL]
I got it for my brother to[NL]
help him with his job as a guard.[ANL]
He[BeatSmooth]doesn't need it anymore,[.4] but I'm sure[NL]
he'd have wanted you to have it.[A]

## Ch3_Village3
[MidRight][LoadCurrentPortrait]
[MidLeft][LoadVillageMan4]
Finally![.5] Someone to put[NL]
the masons in their place![ANL]
The rebellion hasn't done a thing[NL]
to stop them since they got here.[ANL]
Here,[.4] take my spare axe and[NL]
give 'em a good wallop for me.[A]

## Ch3_House
[MidRight][LoadCurrentPortrait]
[MidLeft][LoadVillageMan6]
Oh wow.[.5] You actually came here.[ANL]
Most people just visit the houses[NL]
with red roofs so they get stuff.[ANL]
Seriously,[.4] I don't get why you'd want to[NL]
give some stranger your stuff like that.[ANL]
And to make things worse, nobody wants to[NL]
visit us because they won't get anything.[ANL]
Oh well,[.4] I guess it has its upsides.[NL]
Even bandits avoid brown roof houses.[A]

She ran off during the battle.[A]

Devan Silvare?[.5][NL]

//Devan
[Left]
[Beat]Yes.[A]

//Mayor
[FarRight]
Thank the Specters.[ANL]
Maybe we can finally get[NL]
some peace around here.[A]

//Devan
[Left]
About that, why were[NL]
you being attacked?[ANL]
I thought the towns[NL]
around here have guards.[A]

//Mayor
[FarRight]
We did until Count Varley[NL]
drafted them all.[ANL]
Of course doing that left us[NL]
defenseless from the Masons[Beat][A]

//Ronni
[FarLeft]
Yeah, I was wondering about that.[ANL]
I know the Masons rob people, but[NL]
why would they be burning houses?[A]

//Mayor
[FarRight]
That would be because some of the[NL]
people here tried pushing back.[ANL]
They even took an offer from some[NL]
thieves to steal back some food.[A]

//Ronni
[FarLeft]
[Beat]Lucy?[A]

//Devan
[Left]
And you let this happen?[A]

//Mayor
[FarRight]
It all happened before[NL]
I knew what was going on.[A]

//Alexandra
[Right]
Ehem.[.4] Our mission?[A]

//Mayor
[FarRight]
Hm?[A]

//Devan
[Left]
It seems my associate has little[NL]
patience for this line of discussion.[ANL]
I'll see about sparing you some supplies,[NL]
but first, I have a few more questions.[A]

//Mayor
[FarRight]
Sure.[.4] Ask away.[A]

//Devan
[Left]
What can you tell us about the Varleys?[.5][NL]
Condition, location, things like that.[A]

//Mayor
[FarRight]
Well[Beat] we heard a while back that[NL]
the Varleys lost to the margrave.[A]

//Devan
[Left]
The margrave is here?[A]

//Mayor
[FarRight]
Last I heard.[A]

//Devan
[Left]
And what of the Varleys?[A]

//Mayor
[FarRight]
Count Varley got[NL]
locked up in his keep.[A]

//Alexandra
[Right]
Is that so[Beat][A]

//Ronni
[FarLeft]
And what about Janice?[A]

//Mayor
[FarRight]
Ah,[.4] well,[.4] she[Beat][Event]she[NL]
died fighting the margrave.[A]

//Ronni
[FarLeft]
[Beat]E-Excuse me.[A]
[ClearFace]

//Devan
[Left]
[Beat]Is there anything else?[A]

//Mayor
[FarRight]
That's all I can think of.[A]

//Devan
[Left]
Then we'll end our talk here.[.5][NL]
We[CloseEyes][BeatSmooth]could do with some rest.[A]

//Mayor
[FarRight]
Ah, yes, of course.[NL]
Feel free to stay at the inn.[ANL]
I'm sure the keeper'll let you stay[NL]
for free after what you did for us.[A]

//Devan

//Mayor

way to the inn now.[ANL]
Thank you for[NL]
your hospitality.[A]

//Absalom

Oh no.[A]

//Evelyn

What?[A]

//Absalom

She's got the same glint[NL]

The one that means we're[NL]
gonna hear a crazy idea.[A]

//Evelyn
[Left][HalfCloseEyes]
Absalom[Beat][A]

//Alexandra

No, he's not wrong.[.5] I do have an idea.[Left][OpenEyes][Right][ANL][ToggleSmile]
This could be my chance to do in[NL]
mere days what would take Caius months.[A]

[ToggleSmileFar]

//Evelyn

You don't mean[Beat][A]

[ToggleSmileFar]

//Alexandra
[Right]
I do.[.5] We're going[NL]
to take Masaint Keep.[A]

[ToggleSmileFar]

//Absalom
[FarLeft]
Can we even do that?[ANL]
Without dying, I mean.[A]

//Alexandra
[Right]
I'm sure Count Silvare knows[NL]
something about how to get in.[A]

//Evelyn
[Left]
And if we encounter this margrave?[A]

//Alexandra
[Right][ToggleSmile]
All the better.[ANL]
If we capture him, the civil[NL]
war will come to an end.[ANL]
And the empire will[NL]
have me to thank for it.[A]


[ToggleSmileFar]

//Evelyn
[Left]
Do you not suppose this[NL]
might be too dangerous?[A]

Given the potential rewards,[NL]

That doesn't make it any better.[ANL]
[Beat]I can't even remember the[NL]
last thing we talked about.[A]

//Devan
[MidRight]
[Beat][A]

//Ronni
[MidLeft]
That's right.[.4] We were arguing[NL]
about socks.[.5][Blink][CloseEyes] Socks of all things.[A]

//Devan
[MidRight]
Well, you two could argue[NL]
about anything for hours.[A]

//Ronni
[MidLeft]
Yeah[Beat] I guess she[NL]
didn't like me that much.[A]

//Devan
[MidRight]
That's not true.[ANL]
She cared enough to willingly[NL]
spend all that time with you.[A]

//Ronni
[MidLeft][HalfCloseEyes]
I guess[Beat][A]

//Devan

Besides, you two got along fine[NL]
when you were up to mischief.[A]

[ToggleSmileFar]

//Ronni

Weren't you right[NL]
there with us?[A]

//Devan

Yes. Half the[NL]
time as a victim.[A]

//Ronni
[MidLeft][OpenEyes]
When did we ever[NL]
make you a victim?[A]

//Devan
[MidRight]
Remember the time Janice taught[NL]
you how to hold a fireball?[ANL]
You two nearly set me on fire.[A]

//Ronni
[MidLeft]
But we didn't.[A]

//Devan
[MidRight]
No, but I can't say the same[NL]
about Max's favorite chair.[A]

//Ronni
[MidLeft]
Oh, that's right.[ANL][ToggleSmile]
One of the few times he lectured us[NL]
for something other than arguing.[ANL][ToggleSmile]
Oh Max[Beat] He must be heartbroken[Beat][A]

//Devan
[MidRight]
Which makes it that much more[NL]
important that we reach him.[A]

//Ronni
[MidLeft]
But he's in Masaint Keep.[.5][NL]
That place can keep out an army.[ANL]
How are we supposed to get him out?[A]

//Devan
[MidRight]
Remember the tunnels?[A]

//Ronni
[MidLeft]
Wait, you mean[Beat][.5][NL]
You think it'll work?[A]

//Devan
[MidRight]
I can at least be sure[NL]
we'll get inside.[ANL]
The rest will take[NL]
some planning.[A]

You misguided fool[Beat][ANL]
You soil your grandfather's name.[A]

//Alister

On the contrary, Count Varley.[ANL]
To believe staying with Tolva would[NL]
do us any good is beyond foolishness.[A]

we must be decisive.[A]

Your decisiveness[NL]
killed my daughter![A]
