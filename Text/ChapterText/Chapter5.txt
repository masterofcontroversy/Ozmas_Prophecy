## Ch5_Scene1
//Absalom
[MidLeft][LoadAbsalom]
I-Is it me or is it getting c-colder?[ANL]
Feels like I'm turning t-to a human icicle[A]

//Evelyn
[MidRight][LoadEvelyn]
All that time with Lord Apis[NL]
and a little cold bothers you?[A]

//Absalom
[MidLeft]
Yeah.[.4] Aren't you?[A]

//Evelyn
[MidRight]
Not enough to neglect[NL]
the duties of a soldier.[ANL]
[Beat]Including stoicism.[A]

//Absalom
[MidLeft]
You know what?[.4] You're right.[ANL]
What's a little frostbite[NL]
compared to how cold you are?[A]

//Evelyn
[MidRight]
Your poor attempts at humor are far[NL]
more hazardous than any cold spell.[A]

//Absalom
[MidLeft]
If they bug you that much, why[NL]
not fly off like you normally do?[A]

//Evelyn
[MidRight]
As much as I would like to, it's[NL]
colder in the sky than it is here.[A]

//Absalom
[MidLeft]
Isn't scouting one of those
duties you just mentioned?

//Evelyn
[MidRight]
Ugh[Beat][A]
[X]

//Ronni
[Left]
[Beat]Are they always like this?[A]

//Alexandra
[Right]
It's worsened by the cold,[NL]
but yes, unfortunately.[A]

//Ronni
[Left]
Winter's sure going[NL]
to be something[Beat][A]

//Absalom
[FarLeft][LoadAbsalom]
What was that?[A]

//Alexandra
[Right]
You mean[Beat] we're not[NL]
in an early winter?[A]

//Ronni
[Left]
That's right.[ANL]
We've got a bit more until[NL]
we're at winter temperatures.[A]

//Alexandra
[Right]
It's a wonder you can[NL]
survive this climate.[A]

//Devan
[FarLeft]
Between the cold, snow storms, and[Beat][NL]
each other, not many of us do.[A]

//Absalom
[FarLeft]
Then why settle here[NL]
in the first place?[ANL]
Most people want to live where[NL]
they can[Beat] y'know, live, yeah?[A]

//Ronni
[Left]
We've got ice, metals and a ton of[NL]
stone. They used to go for a lot.[A]

//Absalom
[FarLeft]
What happened?[A]

//Devan
[FarLeft]
The war with Cassis.[ANL]
When it broke out, Tolva forced us[NL]
to cut ties with our best customer.[ANL]
Naturally, with fewer alternatives,[NL]
we had to settle for lower prices.[A]

//Alexandra
[Right]
Surely you had a recourse.[A]

//Devan
[MidRight]
It's just as Evelyn said.[.4][NL]
Our flying enemies are slowing down.[A]

[MidLeft]
And so is Evelyn herself.[.4][NL]
She'd best be careful[Beat][A]
[X]

## Ch5_InitialStormEnd
[MidLeft][LoadAlexandra]
[MidRight][LoadDevan]

//Alexandra
[MidLeft]
A fine plan this was, Count Silvare![.4][NL]
The storm died down![A]

//Devan
[MidRight]
Then we'll have to hold out for now.[.4][NL]
The winds will return soon. [Beat]I hope.[A]
[X]

## Ch5_InitialStormResume
[MidLeft][LoadDevan]

//Max
[MidRight]
So you sense it, too.[.4][NL]
The storm is about to pick up.[A]
[X]

## Ch5_StormWarning1_ver2

about to return.[ANL][CloseEyes]

//Max
[MidLeft]
Do you see that, Veronica?[.4][NL]
It's the eye.[A]

//Ronni
[MidRight][ToggleSmile]
Great![.4] That should[NL]
give us plenty of time![A]

[ToggleSmileFar]

//Max
[MidLeft]
Don't get complacent.[ANL]
One false move and[NL]
it's all over for us.[A]

//Ronni
[MidRight]
Er.[.4] Right.[A]

Right.[A]
[X]

## Ch5_SnowWarning2_ver2
[MidLeft][LoadKenneth]
[MidRight][LoadHolly]

//Kenneth
[MidLeft]
I think the storm's letting up.[A]

//Holly
[MidRight]
But there are still griffons around.[.4][NL]
We'd best get moving.[A][CloseSpeechSlow]
[MoveFarFarLeft]

//Kenneth
[MidLeft]
Wait! you can't just run off like that![ANL]
[Beat]And there she goes. I wonder if[NL]
it was this bad for Brittany[Beat][A]
[X]

## Ch5_SnowWarning3_ver1
[MidLeft][LoadAbsalom]
[MidRight][LoadEvelyn]

//Absalom
[MidLeft]
Shoot.[.4] Looks like the[NL]
storm's letting up.[A]

//Evelyn
[MidRight][CloseEyes]
Finally.[A]

//Absalom
[MidLeft]
What are you so happy about?[.4][NL]
This storm's keeping us safe![A]

//Evelyn
[MidRight][OpenEyes]
Perhaps it's keeping you safe, but[NL]
it's treating me like a ragdoll.[A]

//Absalom
[MidLeft]
Oh.[.4] Almost forgot.[.4][ToggleSmile] Eheheh[Beat][A]
[X]

## Ch5_SnowWarning_Final

[MidLeft][LoadAbsalom]
[MidRight][LoadEvelyn]

//Absalom
[MidLeft]
Did you see that?[ANL]
Pegasus knights just dropped[NL]
off more soldiers.[ANL][ToggleSmile]
Y'know, maybe[NL]
we should do it sometime.[A]

[ToggleSmileFar]

//Evelyn
[MidRight]
The two of us?[.4] Alone?[.4][NL]
Hundreds of feet in the air?[A][2NL]
[Beat]I suppose we could try it.[A]

//Absalom
[MidLeft]
Good point.[.4] Never mind.[A]
