//Absalom
[Left]
Whew.[.5] How much further?[A]

//Colton
[MidRight]
Won't be long now.[ANL]
Keep your eyes peeled for[NL]
the mouth of the cave.[A]

//Absalom
[Left]
Masons living in a cave, huh?[ANL]
Say, how did they end up[NL]
doing the bandit thing?[ANL]
Couldn't get enough[NL]
work as carving rock?[A]

//Ronni
[FarLeft]
Most of them are deserters from[NL]
some military force or another.[ANL]
Their leader used to be[NL]
one of Max's captains.[A]

//Absalom
[Left]
Wait, then why are they[NL]
called the Stonemasons?[A]

//Ronni
[FarLeft][ToggleSmile]
You don't know?[A]

[ToggleSmileFar]

//Absalom
[Left]
No.[.4] That's why I asked.[.5][NL]
C'mon, tell me.[A]

[ToggleSmileFar]

//Ronni
[FarLeft]
[Beat]Nah.[.5] I think I'll let[NL]
you see for yourself.[A][2NL]

[ToggleSmileFar]

//Absalom
[Left]
Thanks a lot[Beat] Colton?[A]

[ToggleSmileFar]

//Colton
[MidRight]
You think I'm going to pass up on a[NL]
chance to see you notice first-hand?[A]

[ToggleSmileFar]

//Absalom
[Left]
At least give me a hint.[ANL]
Does it have something[NL]
to do with rocks?[A]

[ToggleSmileFar]

//Lucy
[Beat]What was that?[A]

//Evelyn
[MidLeft]
It was just a rabbit.[ANL]
You don't need[NL]
to be so on-edge.[ANL]
We're all keeping[NL]
an eye out for danger.[A]

//Lucy
[MidRight]
Right, right.[.5] I just don't to get[NL]
run off again like last time.[A]

//Evelyn
[MidLeft]
What did happen last time?[A]

//Lucy
[MidRight]
Well, I was doing pretty good.[ANL]
I found this neat tome on ice magic[NL]
and ducked behind a pillar.[ANL]
But then I sneezed right[NL]
when a Mason was walking by.[A]

//Evelyn
[MidLeft]
I see.[A]

//Lucy
[MidRight]
They started chasing[NL]
me and I ran away.[ANL]
That's when I met you guys.[A]

//Evelyn
[MidLeft]
Well, I can assure you there[NL]
won't be any need to run this time.[ANL]
Just stay close to the rest of[NL]
the group and you'll be fine.[A]

//Lucy
[MidRight]
Thanks.[.5] Beats having another[NL]
chance to let Colton down again.[A]

//Evelyn
[MidLeft]
He shouldn't have put a girl your[NL]
age up to such a task to begin with.[ANL]
If he has you doing anything else[NL]
of that nature, let me know.[A]

//Lucy
[MidRight]
No, no.[.5] It's okay.[.5][NL]
He really does a lot for me.[A]

//Evelyn
[MidLeft]
Like nearly getting[NL]
you killed by deserters?[A]

//Lucy
[MidRight]
But I asked him to let me.[ANL]
I wanted to help him[NL]
back at least a little.[A]

//Evelyn
[MidLeft]
What did he do to earn[NL]
such loyalty from you?[A]

//Lucy
[MidRight]
Oh.[.5] Well[Beat][NL]
Can you keep a secret?[A]

//Evelyn
[MidLeft]
That depends on what[NL]
you're about to tell me.[A]

//Lucy
[MidRight]
[Beat]When I was really young,[NL]
my parents were in a lot of debt.[ANL]
After a while, they decided they[NL]
could pay it off by selling me.[A][2NL]
[Beat]At least, that's what I was told.[A]

//Evelyn
[MidLeft]
You poor thing[Beat][A]

//Lucy
[MidRight]
I got through it okay.[ANL]
It was rough at first when I was missing[NL]
spots while cleaning or dropping things.[ANL][ToggleSmile]
But then I got better and didn't[NL]
get in as much trouble anymore.[A]

[ToggleSmileFar]

//Evelyn
[MidLeft]
Either way, it's a[NL]
relief you're here now.[ANL]
[Beat]Relatively speaking.[A]

[ToggleSmileFar]

//Lucy
[MidRight]
Tell me about it.[A]

[ToggleSmileFar]

//Evelyn
[MidLeft]
So, how does Colton[NL]
fit into this?[A]

//Lucy
[MidRight]
Oh.[.5] Right.[.5] A few months ago--[A]

//Colton

Did they see us coming?[A]

//Colton
[Right]
Of course they did.[ANL]
Our chatterboxes made sure of that.[A]

//Absalom
[MidLeft]
Didn't you just[NL]
yell two minutes ago?[A]

//Colton
[Right]
To tell you to shut up![ANL]
Anyway, without the element of surprise,[NL]
we'll need to fight our way through.[A]

//Absalom
[MidLeft]
Lemme guess.[.5] We'll do all the fighting[NL]
while you slink off to the treasure.[A]

Hey, Lucy.[.5] Catch.[A]

//Lucy
[MidRight]
Huh? A key?[A]

//Colton
[MidLeft]
It should open those chests.[.5][NL]
It's my last one, so don't lose it.[ANL]
Actually, on second thought,[NL]
you should give it to someone else.[A]

//Lucy
[MidRight]
I'll be fine, Colton.[NL]
You can trust me.[A]

//Colton
[MidLeft]
I did.[ANL]
With the skeleton key.[ANL]
The one you lost.[A]

//Lucy
[MidRight]
I was being chased![A]

How're you holding up, Lucy?[A]

//Lucy
[FarRight]
I'll be fine.[ANL][ToggleSmile]
I think I'm starting to get[NL]
used to this fighting thing.[A]

[ToggleSmileFar]

//Evelyn
[Left]
I wouldn't be so[NL]
happy about that[Beat][A]

//Ronni
[FarLeft][ToggleSmile]
Happy to hear it.[ANL]
I'm gonna go keep an eye on Colton.[NL]
Don't want him taking more than his share.[A]

[ToggleSmileFar]

//Lucy
[FarRight]
Aw, Colton wouldn't--[.5][NL]
you know what?[.5] That's a good idea.[A]

//Evelyn
[Left]
Do you want any help?[A]

//Ronni
[FarLeft]
I'll be fine.[.5] I know how to[NL]
deal with guys like him.[A]
[ClearFace]

//Evelyn
[Left]
[Beat]Speaking of Colton, you[NL]
never got to finish your story.[A]

//Lucy
[FarRight]
Right. Colton robbed the house[NL]
I was in and unlocked my room door.[A]

//Evelyn
[Left]
Why would he do that?[A]

//Lucy
[FarRight]
When I caught up to him, he said he[NL]
thought he'd find something valuable.[ANL]
He left the door unlocked[NL]
because he wanted a distraction.[A]

//Evelyn
[Left]
And he's been letting you[NL]
tag along with him ever since.[A]

//Lucy
[FarRight]
That's right.[ANL]
Oh![.5] I should get to work[NL]
before Colton yells at me.[A][CloseSpeechSlow]
Later, Miss Evelyn.[A]
[ClearFace]

//Evelyn
[Left]
So he at least has[NL]
something resembling a heart.[A]
