//Absalom
[Left]
Man, this sure is some climb[Beat][A]

//Ronni
[FarLeft]
Imagine how bad it is for the horses.[.5][NL]
Hey, Colton, how much further?[A]

//Colton
[MidRight]
Won't be long now.[ANL]
Keep a lookout for[NL]
the cave's mouth.[A]

//Absalom
[Left]
A cave, huh?[.5] That's where the[NL]
Masons are keeping the goods?[A]

//Colton
[MidRight]
Yeah, if you[NL]
can call them that.[ANL]
They don't have anything[NL]
worth the trouble.[A]

//Ronni
[FarLeft]
Then why did you offer[NL]
to steal it back?[A]

//Colton
[MidRight]
I didn't.[.5] Lucy volunteered without[NL]
asking me and I got wrapped up in it.[A]

//Ronni
[FarLeft]
So that's what happened.[.5][NL]
Makes sense.[ANL]
I didn't think you'd[NL]
be nice enough to do that.[A]

//Colton
[MidRight]
It's called self-preservation.[ANL]
No one in their right mind would[NL]
deal with the Masons for peanuts.[A]

//Ronni
[FarLeft]
Lucy did.[A]

//Colton
[MidRight]
I said [OpenQuote]in their right mind[CloseQuote].[A]

//Absalom
[Left]
Hey, speaking of the Masons,[NL]
did they become a thing anyway?[ANL]
Did masonry go out[NL]
of style here or something?[A]

//Ronni
[FarLeft]
Most of them are deserters from[NL]
some military force or another.[ANL]
Their leader used to be[NL]
one of Max's captains.[A]

//Absalom
[Left]
Wait, then why are they[NL]
called the Stonemasons?[A]

//Ronni
[FarLeft][ToggleSmile]
You don't know?[A]

[ToggleSmileFar]

//Absalom
[Left]
No.[.4] That's why I asked.[.5][NL]
C'mon, tell me.[A]

[ToggleSmileFar]

//Ronni
[FarLeft]
[Beat]Nah.[.5] I think I'll let[NL]
you see for yourself.[A][2NL]
It's funnier that way.[A]

[ToggleSmileFar]

//Absalom
[Left]
Thanks a lot[Beat] Colton?[A]

[ToggleSmileFar]

//Colton
[MidRight]
You think I'm going to pass up on a[NL]
chance to see you notice first-hand?[A]

[ToggleSmileFar]

//Absalom
[Left]
At least give me a hint.[ANL]
Does it have anything[NL]
to do with rocks?[A]

//Lucy
[Beat]Huh!?[.4] What was that?[A]

//Evelyn
[MidLeft]
A hare.[A]

//Lucy
[MidRight]
Oh. [Beat]! And that?[A]

//Evelyn
[MidLeft]
A hawk hunting the hare.[ANL]
You needn't worry so much.[NL]
We're all keeping our eyes out.[A]

//Lucy
[MidRight]
Right, right.[.5] I just really don't[NL]
want to get surprised like last time.[A]

//Evelyn
[MidLeft]
What did happen last time?[A]

//Lucy
[MidRight]
Well, I was doing[NL]
pretty good at first.[ANL]
I even found this[NL]
neat tome on ice magic.[ANL]
[Beat]But right after I picked[NL]
it up, someone walked in.[ANL]
I hid behind a pillar, but[NL]
right when he walked by, I[Beat][A]

//Evelyn
[MidLeft]
You[Beat]?[A]

//Lucy
[MidRight]
I sneezed.[.5] Before I knew it,[NL]
I was running for my life.[ANL]
That's when I met you guys.[A]

//Evelyn
[MidLeft]
Well, Rest assured you won't[NL]
have to go through that again.[ANL]
Just make sure you stay near[NL]
the group so we can assist you.[A]

//Lucy
[MidRight]
Yeah, that's what Colton told me.[ANL]
I don't think he trusts[NL]
me with doing this anymore.[A]

//Evelyn
[MidLeft]
He shouldn't have entrusted[NL]
such a task to you to begin with.[ANL]
If he has you doing anything[NL]
else of that nature, let me know.[A]

//Lucy
[MidRight]
No, no.[.5] It's okay.[.5][NL]
He really does a lot for me.[A]

//Evelyn
[MidLeft]
Like nearly getting[NL]
you killed by deserters?[A]

//Lucy
[MidRight]
It's not really his fault.[.5][NL]
I kinda made him let me.[ANL]
I'm why he got dragged into the job,[NL]
so I couldn't let him do it alone.[A]

//Evelyn
[MidLeft]
How did one as kind as you fall[NL]
in with a man so devoid of morals?[A]

//Lucy
[MidRight]
He's not all bad.[ANL]
He helped me out of a[NL]
tight spot a while ago.[A]

//Evelyn
[MidLeft]
And now he's making you repay him.[A]

//Lucy
[MidRight]
No, no.[.5] He--[A]

//Colton
[FarFarRight]
Get a move on![NL]
We're here![A]

They're looking right at us.[NL]
Did they see us coming?[A]

//Colton
[Right]
Of course they did.[ANL]
Our chatterboxes made sure of that.[A]

//Absalom
[MidLeft]
Didn't you just[NL]
yell two minutes ago?[A]

//Colton
[Right]
To tell you to shut up![ANL]
Anyway, without the element of surprise,[NL]
we'll need to fight our way through.[A]

//Absalom
[MidLeft]
Lemme guess.[.5] We'll do all the fighting[NL]
while you slink off to the treasure.[A]

Hey, Lucy.[.5] Catch.[A]

//Lucy
[MidRight]
Huh? A key?[A]

//Colton
[MidLeft]
It should open those chests.[.5][NL]
It's my last one, so don't lose it.[ANL]
Actually, on second thought,[NL]
you should give it to someone else.[A]

//Lucy
[MidRight]
I'll be fine, Colton.[NL]
You can trust me.[A]

//Colton
[MidLeft]
I did.[ANL]
With the skeleton key.[ANL]
The one you lost.[A]

//Lucy

How're you holding up, Lucy?[A]

I'll be fine.[ANL][ToggleSmile]
I think I'm starting to get[NL]
used to this fighting thing.[A]

[ToggleSmileFar]

//Evelyn
[Left]
I wouldn't be so[NL]
happy about that[Beat][A]

//Ronni
[FarLeft][ToggleSmile]
Happy to hear it.[ANL]
I'm gonna go keep an eye on Colton.[NL]
Don't want him taking more than his share.[A]

[ToggleSmileFar]

//Lucy
[FarRight]
Aw, Colton wouldn't--[.5][NL]
you know what?[.5] That's a good idea.[A]

//Evelyn

Do you want any help?[A]

[ToggleSmileFar]

//Ronni
[FarLeft]
I'll be fine.[.5] I know how to[NL]
deal with guys like him.[A]
[ClearFace]

[ToggleSmile]

//Evelyn
[Left]
[Beat]Speaking of Colton, you[NL]
did get to how you met him.[A]

//Lucy
[FarRight]
Right.[.4] Well[Beat] my parents were[NL]
very poor and in a lot of debt.[ANL]
They heard a local rich man needed[NL]
a new maid, so they put me up to it.[ANL]
They said they'd come back to get me,[NL]
but that was years ago.[A]

//Evelyn
[Left]
You poor thing[Beat][A]

//Lucy
[FarRight]
I got through it okay.[.5][NL]
It was kind of rough at first,[ANL]
but I didn't get in trouble much[NL]
after I stopped dropping things.[A]

//Evelyn
[Left]
Either way, it's good you're here now.[NL]
[Beat]Relatively speaking.[A]

//Lucy
[FarRight][ToggleSmile]
Tell me about it.[A]

[ToggleSmileFar]

//Evelyn
[Left]
So, How does Colton[NL]
fit into this?[A]

//Lucy
[FarRight]
Right.[.5] Colton robbed the house[NL]
I was in and unlocked my room door.[A]

//Evelyn
[Left]
Why would he do that?[A]

//Lucy
[FarRight]
When I caught up to him, he said he[NL]
thought he'd find something valuable.[ANL]
He left the door unlocked[NL]
because he wanted a distraction.[A]

//Evelyn
[Left]
And he's been letting you[NL]
tag along with him ever since.[A]

//Lucy
[FarRight]
That's right.[ANL]
Oh![.5] I should get to work[NL]
before Colton yells at me.[A][CloseSpeechSlow][ToggleSmile]
Later, Miss Evelyn.[A]
[ClearFace]

[ToggleSmile]

//Evelyn

So he at least has[NL]
something resembling a heart.[A]

//Colton

That should be everything.[A]

//Alexandra
[FarLeft]
It seems we were correct.[.5][NL]
There isn't much of value here.[A]

//Devan
[Left]
I wouldn't say that.[.5][NL]
Look at this.[A]

//Alexandra
[FarLeft]
Bags of[Beat] grain?[A]

//Devan
[Left]
Along with medicine,[NL]
and furs, among other things.[ANL]
I thought the Masons[NL]
would prioritize these.[A]

//Alexandra
[FarLeft]
They raided all these[NL]
towns for grain and furs?[A]

//Colton
[Right]
Yeah. Not everyone here gets as[NL]
much food as you do in Margos.[A]

//Devan
[Left]
And with winter's fast approach,[NL]
these supplies are especially desired.[A]

//Alexandra
[FarLeft]
So that's why the people of Glasswater[NL]
were desperate enough to hire you.[A]

//Lucy
[FarRight]
Could you have maybe[NL]
put that differently[Beat]?[A]

//Devan
[Left]
I'll hand these supplies[NL]
off to be distributed.[ANL]
Once I'm finished,[NL]
we'll depart for Tristis.[A]

//Alexandra
[FarLeft]
Now, Colton, there's a matter[NL]
I need to discuss with you.[A]

//Colton
[Right]
Uh huh?[A]

//Alexandra
[FarLeft]
What is it you from me?[ANL]
I wish to settle my debt[NL]
as soon as possible.[A]

//Colton
[Right]
Oh, I'll let you know[NL]
when I'm ready to tell you.[ANL]
Until then, we'll be tagging along.[A]

//Lucy
[FarRight]
We are?[A]

//Colton
[Right]
We need to make sure Miss Quirin[NL]
here holds up her end of the bargain.[A]

//Alexandra
[FarLeft]
You speak as though I[NL]
consent to this arrangement.[A]

//Colton
[Right]
I don't know why you wouldn't.[ANL]
All we need is room, board, and a salary,[NL]
and we'll work our magic for you.[A]

//Alexandra
[FarLeft][HalfCloseEyes]
If anything, I would pay[NL]
you to stay away from me.[A]

//Colton
[Right]
Then you don't want someone who can[NL]
get anywhere and has ears everywhere?[ANL]
Sounds like a missed opportunity if[NL]
you're trying to butter up dear old dad.[A]

//Alexandra
[FarLeft][OpenEyes]
What makes you so[NL]
certain that's my goal?[A]

//Colton
[Right]
Why else would you be here?[ANL][ToggleSmile]
The only thing as well-known as your[NL]
brother is how much you play catch-up.[A]

[ToggleSmileFar]

//Alexandra
[FarLeft]
And I suppose your[NL]
talents told you this?[A]

[ToggleSmileFar]

Nah.[.5] Just word on[NL]
the streets of Tolva.[A]

[ToggleSmileFar]

//Alexandra
[FarLeft][CloseEyes]
I-I see.[ANL]
[BeatSmooth][OpenEyes]Fine. I'll allow you to join[NL]
my ranks under one condition:[ANL]
You will obey my every order. Fail me once,[NL]
and you can forget about your favor.[A]

//Colton
[Right]
You have yourself a deal[Beat] boss.[.5][NL]
C'mon, Lucy. Let's get ready to leave.[A]

That's for me to know[NL]

When will I find out?[A]

When I make my request.[A]

//Lucy
[MidLeft]
[Beat]When will that be?[A]

Who knows?[.5] I'm in no rush.[ANL][ToggleSmile]
It's a nice feeling having[NL]
that lordling in my debt.[ANL]
Besides, we might get to see more[NL]
of the world.[.5] That'll be exciting.[A]

[MidLeft]
Oh![.4] You think we might run[NL]
into someone who'll[Beat] y'know[Beat][A]

Maybe.[.4] Don't get[NL]
your hopes up, though.[ANL]
A klutz who can fling fireballs[NL]
is a hard sell for anyone.[A]

//Lucy
[MidLeft]
Why do you always[NL]
have to be so mean?[A]

//Colton
[MidRight]
Not so fast.[.5][NL]
You're clumsy, but we can work on that.[ANL][ToggleSmile]
Then whoever takes you in won't have to[NL]
worry about their house burning down.[A]

You'll help me?[A]
