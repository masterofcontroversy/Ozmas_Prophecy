you'd steal it back?[A]

I didn't.[.5] Lucy volunteered without[NL]

you'd be nice enough to offer.[A]

I don't think he trusts[NL]

He shouldn't have entrusted[NL]
such a task to you to begin with.[ANL]

[MidRight]
No, no.[.5] It's okay.[.5][NL]
He really does a lot for me.[A]

//Evelyn

Like nearly getting[NL]
you killed by deserters?[A]

//Lucy
[MidRight]
It's not really his fault.[.5][NL]
I kinda made him let me.[ANL]
I'm why he got dragged into the job,[NL]
so I couldn't let him do it alone.[A]

//Evelyn
[MidLeft]
How did one as kind as you fall[NL]
in with a man so devoid of morals?[A]

//Lucy
[MidRight]
He's not all bad.[ANL]
He helped me out of a[NL]
tight spot a while ago.[A]

And now he's making you repay him.[A]

When I caught up to him, he said he[NL]
