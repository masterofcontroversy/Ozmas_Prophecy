There's a pebble in my boot.[NL]
Can we stop for a sec?[A]

//Devan
[MidLeft]
Sorry, Ronni.[.4] We need to keep moving.[NL]
Just ride Bowie for a bit.[ANL]
We're late enough as it stands, and it's[NL]
unwise to make a general wait.[A]

//Ronni
[MidRight]
I still can't believe[NL]
Tolva sent one here.[A]

//Devan
[MidLeft]
And I still don't want[NL]
to think about it.[A]

//Ronni
[MidRight]
Well,[.4] we do need the help.[ANL]
The Rebellion's had us[NL]
on the ropes for months.[ANL]
Besides, we just need to[NL]
report to the general, right?[A]

//Devan
[MidLeft]
Right.[.5] With any luck[NL]
he'll at least be agreeable.[ANL]
And if not, at least Max and Lazarus[NL]
will be dealing with him the most.[A]

lead where we're going.[A][2NL]
You don't suppose[BeatSmooth][A]

After that, he put Jeb[NL]

Ouch! Poor guy.[NL]
Why'd he pick Jeb?[A]

Update from the count:[ANL]
keep an eye out for any enemy troops.[NL]
Looks like they're close.[A]

//Kenneth

They are?[.4] Is it a scouting team?[A]

I hope so.[ANL]
We really don't want to[NL]

Ugh.[.4] I didn't think we'd run[NL]
into any trouble here on the way.[ANL]
We're in Western Duramontis.[.4] Why do we[NL]
need to be on the lookout for the enemy?[A]

//Anthony
[MidLeft]
That's how war goes, I guess.[ANL]
Everyone's paranoid.[A]

//Kenneth
[MidRight]
I know. [BeatSmooth]I just hope we[NL]

We'll take a few minutes rest[NL]

I don't feel comfortable sticking[NL]

It's not like we[NL]

No, that's fine.[.5] I'll tell them.[ANL]

[Beat]Which brings us[NL]

//Caius
[MidRight]
What a complete mess[Beat][NL]
How did this happen?[A]

//Lazarus
[MidLeft]
I could give you a host of reasons,[NL]
general, but they won't help us now.[A]

//Caius
[MidRight]
Hmph.[.4] In any case,[NL]
where's Count Silvare?[ANL]
I thought he'd have[NL]
been here by now.[A]

//Lazarus
[MidLeft]
I'm sure there's a reason.[NL]
I only hope nothing happened to him[Beat][A]

//Caius
[MidRight]
If he doesn't show before the[NL]
soldiers from Margos get here,[ANL]
we'll have to start without him.[A]

//Lazarus
[MidLeft]
Margos?[.5] Oh, that's right.[NL]
Their heir is arriving.[ANL]
I hear he's something of a prodigy?[A]

//Caius
[MidRight]
Prodigy might be a strong word,[NL]
but he's certainly a bright prospect.[ANL]
If nothing else,[.4] I can trust[NL]
him to carry out orders with success.[A]

//Lazarus

Is that not a given?[A]

I thought your brother[NL]
was to represent Margos.[A]

//Alexandra
[MidRight]
The battle on the main front picked up,[ANL]
so he, and the majority of our[NL]
soldiers, were reassigned there.[ANL]
My grandfather wished to keep[NL]
his promise for troops, so he sent me.[A]

//Caius

[Beat]How many are[NL]
in your number?[A]

One-hundred and three.[A]

//Lazarus
Count Silvare, you're here![.5][NL]
I was beginning to fear the worst![A]

//Devan
[MidRight]
My apologies for being late.[ANL]
I encountered some[NL]
enemy scouts on the way here.[A]

//Lazarus
[FarLeft]
So they've already[NL]
made their first move.[ANL]
It won't be long before[NL]
the rebels march on us[Beat][A]

//Caius
[Left]
We'll discuss that[NL]
after the report.[.5] Silvare.[A]

//Devan
[MidRight]
Yes, of course.[ANL]
The northern counties have[NL]
been able to fend off the rebels,[ANL]
but it won't be long[NL]
before we get overwhelmed.[ANL]
As such, I was sent with a[NL]
request for reinforcements.[A]

//Lazarus
[FarLeft]
How long do you[NL]
think you can last?[A]

//Devan
[MidRight]
Should things stay the course,[NL]
two or three months, Specters willing.[A]

//Caius
[Left]
Then you'll have to wait.[.5][NL]
Masaint should be our chief concern.[A]

//Devan
[MidRight]
Why? What happened?[A]

//Lazarus
[FarLeft]
Masaint was[NL]
taken not long ago.[A]

//Devan
[MidRight]
And its lords?[A]

//Lazarus
[FarLeft]
Missing. The men I sent to seek[NL]
them out have disappeared as well.[ANL]
It seems greater[NL]
measures will be needed.[A]

//Caius
[Left]
No. Our manpower should be[NL]
focused on securing the border.[ANL]
We cannot waste resources looking[NL]
for the count and his daughter.[A]

//Lazarus
[FarLeft]
Count Varley is among the[NL]
most influential of the loyalists.[ANL]
Would you abandon one who has proved[NL]
himself a useful hand of the emperor?[A]

//Caius
[Left]
Were he as influential as you claim,[NL]
None of us would be here now.[ANL]
[Beat]However, suppose you're right.[NL]
We should at least make an attempt.[ANL]
But I won't spare any of my men for it.[A]


//Lazarus
[FarLeft]
That's fine.[.5][NL]
I'm sure I can think of someone.[ANL]
[Beat]Actually, how long will you[NL]
be in the south, Count Silvare.[A]

//Devan
[MidRight]
Indefinitely.[.5][NL]
Why do you ask?[A]

//Lazarus
[FarLeft]
I'm half a mind to send you.[A]

//Devan
[MidRight]
What?[A]

//Caius
[Left]
The boy couldn't even[NL]
arrive to a meeting on time.[ANL]
What makes you think[NL]
he's capable of a rescue?[A]

//Lazarus
[FarLeft]
He was taught by one of the most[NL]
well-respected commanders in Duramontis.[ANL]
And that aside, he knows[NL]
Masaint about as well as Tristis.[ANL]
If you have anyone better[NL]
in mind, I'm all ears.[A]

//Caius
[Left]
[Beat]Fine.[.4] I'll leave it[NL]
to your judgment.[A]

//Lazarus
[FarLeft]
What do you say,[NL]
Count Silvare?[A]

//Devan
[MidRight]
Well, if you think I'm the[NL]
right choice, I'll do it.[A]

//Lazarus
[FarLeft]
Then it's settled.[ANL]
The safest path into Masaint[NL]
should be Gelida Valley.[ANL]
You shouldn't have[NL]
any trouble passing it.[A]

//Caius
[Left]
Well, aside from the[NL]
enemy garrison there.[A]

//Lazarus
[FarLeft]
It's a checkpoint on the border;[.5][NL]
we'll be taking it regardless.[ANL]
Count Silvare only needs to accompany[NL]
whoever will capture and hold it.[A]

//Caius
[Left]
[BeatSmooth]Yes, that's right.[ANL]
I believe I have someone[NL]
in mind for that task.[ANL]
