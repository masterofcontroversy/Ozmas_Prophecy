Ah![A][CloseSpeechSlow][ClearFace][MidLeft][LoadEvelyn]
[Beat]Don't startle me like that.[ANL]
What were you doing[NL]
out so early in the morning?[A]

//Alexandra
[MidRight]
I took inventory,[.4][NL]
polished my equipment,[ANL]
and researched the area,[NL]
among other things.[A]

//Evelyn
[MidLeft]
Excited for the sortie, I see.[A]

//Alexandra
[MidRight]
Anxious would be more accurate.[ANL]
This is the first leg of[NL]
an important rescue mission.[ANL][CloseEyes]
Everything must go flawlessly.[A]

//Evelyn
[MidLeft]
Perfection isn't expected of us;[.5][NL]
we need only carry out our task.[A]

//Alexandra
[MidRight][OpenEyes]
If I am to compare to my brother,[NL]
I must exceed expectations.[A]

//Evelyn

Let's fetch Absalom and be on our way.[A]

//Evelyn

//Alexandra
[MidRight]
He's my guard.[ANL]
It wouldn't do to[NL]
just leave without him.[A]

give him that position,[.4] but alright.[A]

//Devan
[MidLeft]
Oh.[.5] Right.[A]

//Ronni
[FarRight]
You worried?[A]

//Devan
[MidLeft]
Of course I am.[ANL]
Max and Janice are Specters[NL]
know where in enemy territory,[ANL]
we're hardly prepared, and[NL]
everyone's counting on us to find them.[A]

//Ronni
[FarRight]
I'm sure we'll find them.[NL][ToggleSmile]//Smile ON
Heck, they might even find us.[ANL]
Just imagine Janice's face when[NL]
she sees me coming to her rescue.[ANL]
She'll never be able to live it down.[A]

I'm here to[NL]

//Devan
[Right]
That's right.[.5][NL]
Miss Quirin was it?[A]

//Alexandra
[Left]
Yes.[.4] I plotted our course[NL]
through this road[Beat] here.[A]

//Devan
[Right]
[Hmm][Beat] No.[A]

//Alexandra
[Left]
What's wrong with it?[ANL]
It leads us right to our destination[NL]
and it's easy on our troops and wagons.[A]

//Devan
[Right]
It would delay us far too much.[ANL]
And if you wish to go[NL]
anywhere in Duramontis, use sleds.[ANL]
We haven't the time, nor energy, to push[NL]
your wagons through a snow-covered road.[A]

//Alexandra
[Left]
Is the road not maintained?[A]

//Devan
[Right]
Not since the fortress prevented[NL]
smugglers from using it, no.[ANL]
Taking the road, assuming you can find it,[NL]
would be as bad as any other route.[ANL]
We're best off taking this route through[NL]
the hills.[.5] We'll reach the valley sooner.[A]

//Alexandra
[Left]
[Beat]I'll see what I[NL]
can do about the sleds.[ANL]
We'll take the route I picked, however.[NL]
Yours will be too difficult.[A]

//Devan
[Right]
I won't waste precious[NL]
hours for your comfort.[A]

//Alexandra
[Left]
And I won't risk my operation by tiring[NL]
my troops before the fight starts.[A]

//Devan
[Right]
[Beat]Fine.[.5] Is there[NL]
anything else?[A]

//Alexandra
[Left]
No.[A]

//Devan
[Right]
Then I'll take my leave.[ANL]
I must adjust my plans to[NL]
account for this new delay.[ANL]
Come on, Ronni.[A]

And I thought Caius was cranky.[A]

//Alexandra

I won't let him bother me.[.5][NL]
He'll go his own way soon enough.[ANL]
I'm more concerned[NL]
about the road's condition.[ANL]
It seems nobody has paid the valley[NL]
any mind for quite some time[Beat][A]

//Absalom
[FarLeft]
Yeah, so?[A]

//Alexandra
[Left]
[Beat]Never mind.[.5][NL]
I'm probably overthinking things.[ANL]
Let's get to work.[.5] I don't want[NL]
Count Silvare throwing another fit.[A]

//Ronni

So how'd you get locked up?[A]

The men here made the baseless[NL]
assertion that I was a spy![ANL]
To think even bandits had more[NL]
respect for the cloth.[ANL][CloseEyes]
What is our world coming to?[A]

//Devan
[FarRight]
[Beat]Bandits?[A]

//Holly
[Left][OpenEyes]
Yes.[.5] A few stopped me on my way here.[.5][NL]
They called themselves the Stonemasons.[ANL]
Thankfully, as soon as they learned[NL]
I wasn't from the west, they let me go.[ANL]

//Ronni
[FarLeft]
Why would they be[NL]
worried about that?[ANL]

//Devan
[FarRight]
[Beat]Because they cut[NL]
a deal with the rebels.[A]

//Ronni
[FarLeft]
You think so?[A]

//Devan

It's the only explanation[NL]
that makes sense.[ANL]

And you're a direct[NL]

[ToggleSmileFar]//Smile ON

//Holly

That's what brought me down this path.[ANL][ToggleSmile]//Smile OFF
The Specters told me that I[NL]
would encounter a man in need of my help.[ANL]
He'd be tall, have dark hair, from north,[NL]
and of Friedegard's bloodline.[A]

//Devan
[FarRight]
They told you all that,[NL]
but neglected to give you a name?[A]

//Holly
[Left]
Well, I had to interpret most of it,[NL]
but I'm certain it's you.[A]

//Devan
[FarRight]
[Beat]Assuming I believe any of this,[NL]
how could you help me?[A]

//Holly

Does he not believe in the Specters?[A]

//Ronni

No, he does.[.5] He's just[NL]
not a fan of visions.[A]

//Holly
[Left]
Oh, don't tell me he discounts[NL]
them simply because of Ozma.[A]

//Alexandra
[Right]
It's not an uncommon opinion to have.[.5][NL]
Her vision led to the the war with Cassis.[A]

//Holly
[Left]
It was Tolva's hasty[NL]
response that started the war.[ANL]
You cannot blame the[NL]
messenger for doing her job.[A]

//Ronni
[FarLeft]
She said there'd be an evil shadow[NL]
riding the wings of a drake.[ANL]
What'd she think would happen?[A]

//Holly
[Left]
That's irrelevant.[ANL]
The Specters granted us[NL]
a gift of knowledge through Ozma.[ANL]
We only have ourselves to blame for[NL]
the consequences of our response.[ANL]

//Ronni
[FarLeft]
I don't think that'll[NL]
change any minds.[A]
