/*
This changes it so that in Chapter 4 (vanilla FE8):
- Franz, and Gilliam are forced (Eirika is also forced for any other chapter in mode 1). However, Artur is the only unit that is locked into his position; the other three can be repositioned.
- Only certain units can swap with each other

//Group 1: Eirika, Seth, Franz, Ross, and Garcia
//Group 2: Gilliam, Moulder, Vanessa, and Ross
//Group 0: Neimi and Colm
