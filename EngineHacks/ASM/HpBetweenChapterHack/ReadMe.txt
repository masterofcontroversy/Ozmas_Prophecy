This hack lets you configure how much HP to regain between chapters(if at all). It's highly customizable and with various options.

This has pretty straight foward installation and usage.

Installation
Include the .event file somwhere in free space. You may need to edit EMS to account for Current HP when loading the game. Check EMS_Instructions.txt

Usage
You can configure the behaviors using the definitions in the Installer file by editing the pre defined labels . `Configuration|Mode Behavior Definitions|` doesn't need to be changed at all but you can edit `Configuration|Bonus HP` and `Configuration|Fixed heal` to suit your needs. From there you can edit the Link Area with the definitions defined above but you don't need to change the bottom 2.
